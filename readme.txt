Be aware that this is a command line tool and not a fancy gui thingy.

This tool was created around 2001. I have not the slightest clue wether it still works.

There is a binary for windows, but it should compile by any c-compiler.

To use it just run 

smi2txt blah.smi 

smi2txt.exe *.sms

Feel free to use it but don't blame me for any damage caused.
