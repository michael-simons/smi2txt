Be aware that this is a command line tool and not a fancy gui thingy.

This tool was created around 2001. I have not the slightest clue wether it still works.

There are some old binaries:

* Windows x86: https://github.com/downloads/michael-simons/smi2txt/smi2txt.exe
* Mac OS X Universal Binary: https://github.com/downloads/michael-simons/smi2txt/smi2txt_mac_os_x_universal-binary.zip
* Alternativ Version by Gazzetta Luca und Ludger Breil: https://github.com/downloads/michael-simons/smi2txt/smi2txt0.1.1.tgz

There is a binary for  (), but it should compile by any c-compiler.

To use it just run 

smi2txt blah.smi 

smi2txt *.sms

The exe is as old as the tool itself and I don't know if it still runs under modern versions of windows.

The alternative version contains several improvements regarding special characters and stuff. If you have any questions, look at the readme included with the tgz file.

Feel free to use it but don't blame me for any damage caused.
