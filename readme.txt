Be aware that this is a command line tool and not a fancy gui thingy.

This tool was created around 2001. I have not the slightest clue wether it still works.

There is a binary for windows (https://github.com/downloads/michael-simons/smi2txt/smi2txt.exe), but it should compile by any c-compiler.

To use it just run 

smi2txt blah.smi 

smi2txt *.sms

The exe is as old as the tool itself and I don't know if it still runs under modern versions of windows.

Feel free to use it but don't blame me for any damage caused.
